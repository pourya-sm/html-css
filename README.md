This repository is to keep track of my html &amp; css learning history

## GRIDS
  . remember: "display: block;" for img entity makes extra spaces go away on top or bottom of <img> itself.

  . 1fr means 1(relative to free space) free space: takes up the remaining amount of space horizantally
    see "grid.html" for reference.

  .open grid.html to learn all the syntax.

## FLEXBOX
  . remember: If you don't want a part of a flexbox to not shrink, you can use the special property "flex-shrink: 0;" and then the part that is allowed to shrink should be specified with "width: 0;".

## position: fixed
. remember: the four special attributes of position: fixed are "top, left, right, and bottom" .
. remember: in abscence of one or two of the attributes mentioned above, you'll probably need to use height and width attributes.
  see position.html for reference.

## position: absolute
. sticks to parent element (default: body).

## position: relative
. combined with position: absolute; you cant add I.E. the red number on top right of notifications icon or add video times to thumbnails.
